# Project Details: Admin Kit

## 📝 Short Description
**Admin Kit** is a robust, enterprise-grade Admin Dashboard boilerplate built with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. It serves as a solid foundation for SaaS applications, featuring built-in authentication patterns, role-based access control (RBAC), and a modular architecture.
